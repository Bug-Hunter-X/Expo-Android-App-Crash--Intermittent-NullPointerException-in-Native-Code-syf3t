While developing an Expo app, I encountered an issue where the app would crash intermittently on certain Android devices. The crash reports showed a `NullPointerException` in native code, but the JavaScript code didn't reveal any obvious errors. The crashes were not reproducible on iOS or all android devices, making debugging difficult.  The error wasn't consistently tied to a specific action or part of the codebase, leading to prolonged investigation. I also checked the expo managed workflow and expo bare workflow to see if it was related to the expo cli configuration, but it wasn't related to the expo cli configuration.
