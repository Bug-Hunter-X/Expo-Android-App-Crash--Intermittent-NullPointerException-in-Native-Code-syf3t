# Expo Android App Crash: Intermittent NullPointerException

This repository demonstrates an issue where an Expo app crashes intermittently on certain Android devices with a `NullPointerException` in native code, despite no obvious errors in the JavaScript code.  The crashes are difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description

The app crashes randomly on a subset of Android devices. Crash reports indicate a `NullPointerException` in native code, but the JavaScript code does not provide clear clues. The issue is not reproducible across all Android devices or on iOS.

## Reproduction Steps

Reproducing the crash is challenging due to its intermittent nature. It seems to be related to some device-specific factors or specific sequences of actions within the app. The original issue had no specific sequence that triggered the failure.

## Solution

The solution involves a thorough review of all native modules being used within the Expo application. The expo SDK documentation should be reviewed to see if there are any known conflicts or issues with the version being used, particularly for the impacted devices. If native modules are not the cause, then the issue might be related to the device memory management or other system resources, which would require more investigation.  Additional debugging techniques, such as more detailed logging and potentially using a native Android debugger, may be required.
